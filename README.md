# Prisoner Jump Count In Jail Break
Jump Count In Prisoner Jail Break Problem

This solution is for counting number of jumps count by a prisonet to escape a wall in his jail by which he cas escape.

lets,
he can jump heigh X unit in a single jump and then he slips Y length in that. so need to calculate no of jumps required to  escape the jail of heigh H unit.

example:
A can jump 5 ft. in single jump but slip 2 ft. If height of the Jail wall is 10 ft then

1st jump: up 5ft, slips 2 ft=3ft.
2nd jump: up 5ft, slips 2 ft=3ft+3ft=6ft.
3rd jump: up 5ft, slips 2 dt=3ft+6ft=9ft.
4rd jump: up 5ft, slips 2 dt=3ft+9ft=12ft>10 ft.

so he needs to jump 4 time to escape the jail he wants to break out.
